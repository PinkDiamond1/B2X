# Bitcoin NewYork (B2X) - Green and Scaled Bitcoin

Bitcoin NewYork (codename BitcoinNewYork) is a fork of the Bitcoin blockchain that will occur at block height 494784, at roughly 12:00:00 UTC November 16, 2017.

The project carries on the New York Consensus (segwit+2M) from bitcoin community, to make bitcoin thrive and alive. NYA is signed by the group of companies which represents a critical mass of the bitcoin ecosystem. As of May 25, this group represents:

58 companies located in 22 countries
83.28% of hashing power
5.1 billion USD monthly on chain transaction volume
20.5 million bitcoin wallets

At the predetermined block height, BitcoinNewYork miners will begin creating blocks with a new proof-of-work algorithm, and this will cause a bifurcation of the Bitcoin blockchain. The original Bitcoin blockchain will continue on unaltered, but a new branch of the blockchain will split off from the original chain. The new branch is a distinct blockchain with the same transaction history as Bitcoin up until the fork, but then diverges from it. As a result of this process, a new cryptocurrency will be born.

With technology development, B2X chose new Green satoshi consensus. Energy saved 99%, ledger size compressed 99%.100 times greener than ever.

This project name is BitcoinNewYork, tading code changed from BT2 to B2X during mainnet activation.
